Dogen was a Zen monk in the early Kamakura period.
The founder of Soto Zen
Later in his life he also went by the name Kigen.
Within the sect he is referred to by the honorary title Koso.
Posthumously named Bussho Dento Kokushi, or Joyo-Daishi.
He is generally called Dogen Zenji.
He is reputed to have been the one that spread the practices of tooth brushing, face washing, table manners and cleaning in Japan.
Another story has it that he was the first one to bring Moso-chiku (Moso bamboo) to Japan.
Though some points are unclear about Dogen's birth, all accounts agree that he was born in the line of Udaijin (Minister of the Right) Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO (MINAMOTO no Michichika or Michichika KOGA).
Although it is generally accepted that he was born in Shoden Sanso in Kohata, Kyoto, to Michichika and FUJIWARA no Ishi, the daughter of Daijo-daijin (Grand Minister of State) Motofusa MATSUDONO (FUJIWARA no Motofusa), recent research suggests that he may have been the son of Michitomo HORIKAWA, who was presumed to be his adoptive father.
Another account says his father was the son of Michichika, MINAMOTO no Michimune or Michiteru KOGA.
According to the biography "Kenzeiki", he lost his father (Michichika) at 3 years of age, his mother at 8, and was adopted by his half brother Michitomo HORIKAWA.
Yet another account tells that his maternal uncle Moroie MATSUDONO (former Regent and Interior Minister) wanted to adopt him as an heir after his parents died, but Dogen, feeling the uncertainty of the world, declined.
There is a story that he was acquainted with Shinran, the founder of Shin Buddhism, as they were related via their mothers; but there is no proof.
Some have said that the "Life and Death" section of his "Shobogenzo" was written for Shinran.
Kenryaku 3 (1213) - Visited his maternal uncle Ryoken at Mt. Hiei.
1214 - Entered the priesthood under Koen, the head of Tendai Buddhism, and took the name Buppobo Dogen.
1215 - Pursued Tendai religious studies under Koin at Onjo-ji Temple.
1217 - Studied under Myozen, a disciple of Eisai, at Kennin-ji Temple.
1223 - Left from Hakata with Myozen to Southern Song China and visited Jozan, where he received a certificate of dharma transmission from Soto Zen's Tendo Nyozo.
1228 - Returned to Japan.
1233 - Opened Kosho-ji Temple at Fukakusa, Kyoto.
Around this time he came under pressure from Mt. Hiei.
July,1243 - Moved to Echizen Shihi-no-sho at the invitation of Yoshishige HATANO, lord of Echizen Province.
On the way, he stopped in Kutsuki at the invitation of the village chief, Nobutsuna SASAKI (this is the origin of Kosho-ji Temple in Takashima City).
1244 - Opened Daibutsu-ji Temple in Kasamatsu.
1246 - Changed the name of Daibutsu-ji to Eihei-ji Temple, and his own name to Kigen.
Around this time he went to Kamakura to teach, at the invitation of Regent Tokiyori HOJO and Yoshishige HATANO.
Although he only spent half of a year in Kamakura, it was the beginning of a genuine flourishing of Zen in the Kanto region.
1253 - After falling ill and turning over Eihei-ji to his disciple Koun Ejo, he died at the house (Takatsuji-dori Nishinotoin-dori, Kyoto) of a lay disciple, Kakunen, at age 54.
Cause of death was a boil.
He emphasized that Buddhahood is not something that is completed once one has attained a certain level; rather, continuing to seek further Buddhahood through endless training, even after one has become a Buddha, is the essence of Buddhahood (Shusho Ichinyo); and the highest form of training is to be like the Sakyamuni and simply do sitting meditation (Shikan Taza).
Most of Kamakura Buddhism affirmed the notion of the decadent age, but in his Shobogenzo Zuimonki he wrote "I tell you now, this is completely false.
The idea of the decline of true Buddha-dharma is only a temporary means for teaching.
The true teaching is different.
By training according to the teaching, anybody can achieve enlightenment.
The monks at the time of the Sakyamuni were not all outstanding people.
There were those who had rare and incredible evil in their hearts, and there were fools.
The many rules that the Saykamuni made were for the bad and foolish people.
People are all owners of the quality to be able to become Buddha.
Don't think that you are not qualified. If you train according to the teaching, you will surely attain enlightenment." He thus noted that the disciples at the time of Sakyamuni were not all outstanding people, denying the decadent age by saying that it is nothing more than a skillful means.

The Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum is a preservation and display facility for steam locomotives, operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West Japan), located in Kankiji-cho, Shimogyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
On October 10, 1972, the Japan National Railway opened a semicircular garage at the Umekoji engine yard in Shimogyou-ku, Kyoto in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the first railway in Japan. The first of its kind, this facility preserves working steam locomotives, honoring them as precious artifacts of industrial culture that supported the Japanese rail transport system.
JR West Japan took over the facility in 1987, following the breakup and privatization of Japanese National Railways.
The facility itself is also an active depot (Umekoji Railyard), and carries out inspections and maintenance on steam locomotives and Japanese National Railways Diesel Locomotive Class DE10 owned by Sagano Scenic Railway.
Initially, this facility was established for working preservation of steam locomotives, which had begun disappearing rapidly in the latter half of the 1960s.
The Koyama engine yard at Koyama Station in Tochigi Prefecture was the best candidate for the locomotive preservation area because it was close to the capital, but the Umekoji engine yard was chosen in 1970 for its central location in Japan and the presence of other historic spots in the area.
Reviews had been made to select, in principle, lowest-numbered extant steam locomotives (#1 if possible) for preservation, but there are some steam locomotives, such as the Class C62 #2, that were not originally planned for preservation.
The facilities consist of the Steam Locomotive Display Hall, taking advantage of the semicircular garage and turntable of the former Umekoji Engine Depot, and the Educational Display Gallery at the former Nijo Station building which was moved and rebuilt at this location.
The semicircular garage of reinforced concrete construction (built in 1914) was designated as an Important Cultural Property by the Japanese Government on December 10, 2004, along with its 5-ton electric ceiling crane (completed in 1915) and access rails.
In 2004, it was also chosen by the Japan Society of Civil Engineers as a Public Works Heritage site.
In 2006, the former Nijo Station building (gallery) and the semicircular garage, along with the preserved steam locomotives as well as inspection and maintenance equipment, etc. were designated as Railway Memorial Objects and Railway Semi-memorial Objects by JR West Japan.
The former Nijo Station building, built in 1904 by the Kyoto Railway Company to double as a headquarters building, is now the oldest 2-story, wooden, Japanese-style station building, and was modeled after Heian Jingu Shrine with harmony with the surrounding landscape in mind.
It was used as a station building by Japanese National Railways and JR West Japan after Kyoto Railway Company was nationalized in 1907; but its use as a station building ended in 1996, following the elevation of the Sanin Line (Sagano Line) between Nijo and Hanazono Stations (in Kyoto Prefecture), and in 1997 was rebuilt on this site to be used as an entrance, with its original indoor facilities such as ticket windows being used as a gallery.
It was designated a Cultural Property of the City of Kyoto in April 1996.
The semicircular garage houses and displays 18 steam locomotives (originally 17 when the facility first opened) of 16 different classes - all manufactured in Japan from the Taisho to Showa periods.
When this museum opened, there was a rule that locomotives should be preserved in working conditions. In fact, 15 locomotives excluding the two (Class C53 #45 and Class C51 #239) were registered for operation. However, the scope of locomotives to be preserved has been reconsidered several times since then. As of 2006, 7 locomotives of 7 different classes are preserved in working conditions.
Of those, 5 steam locomotives of 5 different classes are still registered for operation, and 2 (Class C57 #1 and Class C56 #160) are in service to pull trains on main lines such as the Yamaguchi on the Yamaguchi Line and the Kita Biwako on the Hokuriku Main Line.
The others in working conditions are registered but cannot run on the main lines because they have not undergone general inspections.
Also, the SL Steamliner - pulled by a locomotive being preserved in working conditions for display in the museum - is running on the tracks of the museum site.
This display track once stretched north from the garage to the northern edge of the grounds, where there is now a parking lot for large vehicles (where a rest facility for the museum and a park were once located). In line with relocation of the former Nijo Station building, it was rearranged to go through the southern edge of Umekoji Park and under the Sagano Line tracks.
Today this is still a functional engine depot, and is connected to rail lines in operation.
After the closing of West Japan Railway Company's Takatori Plant, the facility has also taken over maintenance of steam locomotives.
Ume
Stands for Umekoji
All the steam locomotives, except for Class C62 #1 that was designated in 1976, were designated as Railway Semi-memorial Objects together with its logs and maintenance tools in 2006.
Unless otherwise noted, the steam locomotives were transferred from the previous engine depots in 1972.
Registraion of steam locomotives marked with * had been deleted when they were brought to Umekoji for preservation.

Shomyo is one of the traditional forms of Japanese music.
It is a chant of Buddhist scriptures and a religious music for ceremonies.
It is also called Bonbai and Bonnoku in Japanese.
It is written as 聲明 in the old form.
Shomyo is the name for one of the academic fields (Gomyo) of ancient India.
Gomyo refers to five academic fields - Shomyo (phonology and grammar), Kugyomyo (technics and technology), Ihomyo (medical science), Inmyo (ethics) and Naimyo (study of a scholar's religion, as in Buddhism for a Buddhist).
It was introduced to Japan together with Buddhism and became well established.
There is a record that a Buddhist ceremony involving the use of Shomyo was held at the opening ceremony for the Todai-ji Temple Great Buddha Eye in 754, so it is believed that Shomyo flourished during the Nara period.
During the early Heian period, Saicho and Kukai introduced Shomyo and founded Tendai Shomyo and Shingon Shomyo, respectively.
Buddhist sects other than the Tendai-shu and Shingon-shu sects also have their own Shomyo, each of which has been handed down to the present day.
Because Shomyo was passed down by Kuden (handing down from month to ear), there was no musical notation.
Therefore, its initiation was extremely difficult.
Later, Hakase was invented as an equivalent of musical notation.
There are differences in technical terms (such as Hakase) in each school.
However, Hakase was a reference to chant, and in order to learn Shomyo, kuden (also called roi, or direct initiation by an instructor) was necessary; therefore, conservation and inheritance were impossible from the perspective of a master to a disciple.
Therefore, the development of instructors and successors was a must.
Numerous schools were extinguished due to various circumstances.
Tendai Shomyo developed independently, in accordance with what Saicho had introduced.
After Saicho, Ennin and Annen made it prosperous.
Ryonin, the founder of Yuzunembutsu-shu sect, is known as the patriarch of the Restoration.
In 1109, Ryonin built Raigoin Temple (Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City) in Ohara, Kyoto.
Raigoin Temple, in Ohara, was called Gyozan as the temple's title, having been named after Gyozan, the birthplace of Shomyo in China.
Before long, Raigoin Temple and Shorinin Temple were known as the dojos of Ohara School Gyozan Shomyo.
Jakugen developed a school later, so there were two schools of Shomyo in Ohara.
Subsequently, Shukai restored Ohara Shomyo.
Tanchi established a stream based on a new form of music theory.
Since then, it became the center of Tendai Shomyo, and it has been inherited by the present Tendai Shomyo.
The Yuzunembutsu-shu sect, Jodo-shu sect and Jodo Shinshu sect represent the lineage of Tendai Shomyo.
Shingon Shomyo has been passed down to the present day based on what Kukai introduced.
Shomyo was systematized after Shinga.
Particularly, Kancho was known as the patriarch of the Restoration.
He worked on the composition and control of Shomyo.
There were numerous schools until the Kamakura period, but the princely priest Kakusho reorganized them into four: the Honsoinryu School, Shinsoinryu School, Daigoryu School and Nakagawa-Daishinryu School.
Shomyo, of the Kogi (old) Shingonshu sect, declined and became extinct with the emergence of the Edo period.
The Honsoinryu School, Shinsoinryu School and Daigoryu School were extinguished by the middle of the Meiji period.
Currently, it is divided into Chizan Shomyo (Chishakuin, Kyoto), Buzan Shomyo (Hase-dera Temple, Nara), Nanzan-shinryu School (Mt. Koya-san and Kogi Shingonshu sect temples, Kyoto).
Chizan Shomyo and Buzan Shomyo (Shingi (new) Shingonshu sect Shomyo):Shomyo of Chizan-ha Buddhists, Shingon-shu sect and that of Buzan-ha Buddhists, Shingon-shu sect were originally derived from the Nakagawa-Daishinryu School.
Raiyu took in the traditional school of Daigo.
In 1585, when Negoro-ji Temple (Wakayama Prefecture) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and went into decline, the Chizan and Buzan schools formed a school based on the traditional school of Daigo.
It features Buzan's 'Logic' and Chizan's 'Shomyo.'
Nanzan-shinryu School (Kogi Shingonshu sect Shomyo): This school is based on the Nakagawa-Daishinryu School.
The Nakagawa-Daishinryu School has Daishin, of Naka-no-gawadera Temple, Nara, as the founder of the school.
During the years 1232 and 1233, Shoshin, of Sanboin Temple in Renge-dani (Mt. Koya-san), moved his stronghold to Mt. Koya-san.
Later, it was called the Nanzan-shinryu School, being named after Nanzan, another name for Mt. Koya-san.
It is also called the Shinryu School or the Yasan Shinryu School.
The music of Heikyoku, Yokyoku, Minyo or Joruri can be said to be variations of Shomyo.
Its has had a great impact on monophony (unaccompanied music).
Emperor Tenchi (Tenji)
Male
Empress Suiko (626) - Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) (January 10, 672)
The 38th Emperor
Kokufu Shigo is Amemikoto hirakasuwake no mikoto/Amatsumikoto sakiwake no mikoto
The first name is Kazuraki (Katsuragi).
It is presumed that he was once called Kazuraki no miko (Katsuragi no miko).
He is generally known as Nakano Oe no Oji (Naka no Oe no Miko).
The "oe" means "prince," and "Nakano oe" means "second prince."
Overview
He was the second prince of Emperor Jome.
The mother was Takara no Himemiko (later called Empress Kogyoku).
The Empress was Yamatohime no Okimi, daughter of Emperor's half-brother, Furuhito no Oe no Miko.
The Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) plotted a rebellion with NAKATOMI no Kamatari and seized power in a coup to kill SOGA no Iruka, by which his uncle Emperor Kotoku came to power and he became a prince.
He established a new era--the Taika--and made many reforms during this period (he was a key person in the Taika reforms and Itsushi no hen).
He devised a plan to trap an opposition group that included Arima no Miko, who might have caused a coup in the future, and they were executed.
As Baekje was destroyed by the Silla (Kingdom) and Tang in 660, the Baekje prince, Buyeo Pung, who was staying at the Imperial Court, was sent back to his country to save Baekje.
The Emperor stayed at Tsukushi to send covert troops to Baekje, but Empress Saimei died in 661.
Eventually, the Emperor took control of the government without having an enthronement ceremony, but then he was severely defeated in the Battle of Hakusukinoe and moved to Otsu City to be enthroned in 663.
After the Battle of Hakusukinoe a castle surrounded by water was built, and Noroshi and Sakimori (the conscript soldier system in the old days) were organized to protect the territory.
Moreover, the system of ranking officials was changed from 19 levels to 26 levels.
In 670 the first national family registry, "Kogo-nenjaku," was introduced.
According to "Chronicles of Japan (Nihon Shoki)," the Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) wanted the first prince, Otomo no Miko, to be his successor.
However, after the death of Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) his brother, Oama no Miko (Emperor Temmu), defeated Otomo no Miko in the Jinshin War (the Jinshin Disturbance) and was enthroned.
Subsequently, Emperor Temmu's ancestry remained in power until Empress Shotoku.
After the death of Empress Shotoku, Sirakabe no Okimi, a grandchild of Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) was enthroned as Emperor Konin and subsequently Emperor Tenchi's (Tenji's) ancestry stayed in power.
It is said that because Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) took Nukata no Okimi away from Oama no Miko (Emperor Temmu), he sent his four daughters to Oama no Miko (Emperor Temmu) to become princesses for an expiation.
Brief Personal History
Born in 626
Rittaishi (the ceremony to institute the Crown Prince) was held on July 15, 645.
Politics began without having an enthronement ceremony August 27, 661.
The enthronement was held on February 23, 668.
He died on January 10, 672 at age 46.
(According to "Fuso-Ryakki", he died from an illness, but another explanation that has been offered is that he went missing in the mountains and that Emperor Temmu had him assassinated.)
It was one of the mysteries of the mid-seventh century that Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) did not stay in power for a long time.
Various theories have been suggested in regard to the matter.
This was the consideration for setting up Emperor Temmu's backbone.
There was an accepted theory that Emperor Temmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi (Tenji), but this is denied; another theory is that Emperor Temmu was Aya no Miko, whom Empress Kogyoku had before she married Emperor Jomei, and that he was an older half-brother of Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).
It is apparent that Emperor Temmu was older than Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) after tracing back their ages according to the Emperor Tenchi's (Tenji's) age at death in "Chronicles of Japan (Nihon Shoki)" and the Emperor Temmu's age at death in other history books.
The information is consistent in the same historical records, and there are eight to nine years of age difference between the two emperors.
Some people say that Emperor Temmu's age was purposely falsified since it was an embarrassing fact that the younger brother became the emperor before his older brother even though they are half-brothers with the same mother; but some argue that according to "Chronicles of Japan (Nihon Shoki)," Emperor Temmu's age was 16 when his father, Emperor Jomei, was enthroned, but it was said that he was 16 when his father died.
Therefore, the Emperor's real year of birth is 614, according to the Royal Family Tree (Honcho-koin-jounroku).
It was usual to have no successor to the Imperial Throne for some period (in fact, Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) and Empress Jito, who were in power before and after Emperor Temmu, took control of the government without having an enthronement ceremony).
Some argue that this caused the errors in their ages.
Some people have said that because "Chronicles of Japan (Nihon Shoki)" and other indicated history books are edited in different years and they are different in character, they cannot be treated alike."
Please refer to the section "The Age of Emperor Temmu."
There is a theory that the Isshi no Hen was a coup caused by Karu no Miko (Emperor Kotoku), in which Naka no Oe no Oji (Naka no Oe no Miko) lost his position.
It has recently been indicated that Naka no Oe no Oji (Naka no Oe no Miko) and Sogano Iruka had a relatively good relationship and similar basic policies.
This way there is no reason that Naka no Oe no Oji (Naka no Oe no Miko) would have assassinated Iruka.
Because there is falsification in the definition of Taika's reform in "Chronicles of Japan (Nihon Shoki)," this theory has become apparent.
This theory gets a lot of attention because it can explain Empress Kogyoku's abdication or the reason that the Soga Family (except Iruka) was not displaced from politics after the coup.
There is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) was delayed due to the complaints against his relationship with women.
This is based on the theory that Emperor Kotoku sent a poem to his wife Hashihito no Himemiko (Emperor Tenchi's (Tenji) sister with the same mother) indicating that Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) was having an affair with her, which is contained in "Chronicles of Japan (Nihon Shoki)."
In those days, romance and marriage were allowed between half-sisters and brothers from different mothers but not between half-brothers and sisters from the same mother; however, in the comic story "Tenjo no niji (The Rainbow in the Sky)," by Machiko SATONAKA, it is described that there was a romance involving this kind of forbidden love; Hashihito no Himemiko was persuaded to marry with Karu no Miko (Emperor Kotoku), but she kept the relationship with Emperor Tenchi (Tenji), and Arima no Miko was furious after knowing this and became angry at Hashihito no Himemiko.
There is a theory that Hashihito no Himemiko ascended the throne as the princess of the previous Emperor but one and became an Empress after the death of Empress Saimei; however, for some reason her name was erased from the record.
In the Man'yoshu ("The Anthology of Myriad Leaves)," "Nakatsusumera-mikoto" is considered to be Hashihito no Himemiko, and it is said that the one named "Nakatsusumera-mikoto" was a temporary Emperor until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).
If Hashihito no Himemiko was the same person as "Nakatsusumera-mikoto," there is a question why only she had this special name; alternatively, it is said that this name could have been for Empress Saimei, but there is no proof.
It is hard to prove, since this is about political history with limited data; however, it is expected to have clearer information from close study in relation to the findings of archaeology.
Poems
The Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) was a poet who had four poems in "Man'yoshu (The Anthology of Myriad Leaves)."
He was respected as the Emperor of the Heian dynasty, and one of his poems is found at the beginning of "One Hundred Waka Poems (the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets)."
I am sitting in the barn next to a rice field when rice is harvested in the autumn and my kimono sleeves get wet by night dew, as the roof of the barn is covered with rough-bladed hay.
The following poem is from "Man'yoshu (The Anthology of Myriad Leaves)."
In ancient days, Mt. Kagu-yama loved Mt. Unebi-yama and fought against Mt. Miminashi-yama for love; there is no doubt we still fight for love between wives, as it has been the same since the age of the gods.
The Saionji Family were court nobility descended from the Fujiwara clan.
The Saionji Family was of the Fujiwara clan Fujiwara-hokke Kaninryu, and the Kakaku (family rank of court nobility) was the Seiga Family.
The Toin Family and Imadegawa/Kikutei Family were branch families of the Saionji Family.
There was a samurai family--the Saionji clan in Iyo-no-kuni--as a major offshoot that used the Saionji surname.
The family crest is Hidari-mitsudomoe.
The progenitor of the Saionji Family was FUJIWARA no Michisue, the third son of FUJIWARA no Kimizane.
Kintsune SAIONJI, who was a great grandson of Michisue, was confined by the imperial court during the Jokyu-no-ran War because, having married the niece of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, he was being watched over as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun); after the war, however, Kintsune gained the confidence of the shogunate, wielded the real power in the imperial court through holding the office of Kanto Moshitsugi, and rose to the position of Daijo daijin (grand minister of state), raising the social standing of the Saionji Family.
The family name of Saionji comes from the name of the temple Kintsune built at Bettei, in Kyoto (Kitayama-so, Kadono-gun, Yamashiro-no-kuni).
This hall is also called Kitayama-dono Palace, and the current Kinkaku-ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA after he was given this land by the Saionji Family.
Since the generation of Kintsune, the Saionji Family gained support from the Kamakura shogunate and came to power that surpassed the sekke throughout the Kamakura era.
Sanekane SAIONJI approached Daikaku-ji through genealogy and made his daughters marry Kameyama ho-ou, the ex-emperor, or the Emperor Godaigo.
However, since the generation of Sanekane's son Kinhira SAIONJI, the Saionji Family this time supported the Jimyoin-to genealogy when the Daikakuji-to genealogy started to keep a distance from the bakufu, thereby deepening the conflict with the Daikakuji-to genealogy.
Thereafter, at the generation of Kinmune SAIONJI, the Saionji Family was dismissed from the post of Kanto Moshitsugi after the fall of the Kamakura shogunate.
Kinmune harbored Yasuie HOJO, who was a remnant of the Hojo clan, the assassinated Emperor Godaigo, who had started Kenmu-no-shinsei; plotted a rebellion to back the ex-emperor Gofushimi of Jimyoin-to genealogy; and was arrested and executed, the plot having been exposed by the betrayal of Kinmune's younger brother, Kinshige SAIONJI.
During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, Kinmune's son Sanetoshi SAIONJI served Hokucho (Japan) and rose to the post of minister of the right, whereby the family name was restored.
During the Muromachi and Edo periods the Saionji Family was also known for having biwa (Japanese lute) players as a family business.
In the early days of the Edo period, Saneharu SAIONJI welcomed Tokuhime, who was the eldest daughter of Kyumu NAGAOKA (also known as Tadataka HOSOKAWA), as the Midaidokoro (wife of a shogun or a highest-ranking nobleman) of the heir (later disinherited) of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA, and invited her to accept the post of Sadaijin (minister of the left); moreover, Kyumu NAGAOKA offered various forms of financial support to the Saionji family, including donating a property that yielded 600 koku of rice (Menko-shuroku).
At the end of the Edo period, Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted from the Tokudaiji Family of the same kaninryu, worked as a politician after the Meiji Restoration, served as prime minister, and had great influence as a genro on the political scene during the Taisho and Showa eras.
There is an anecdote that Kinmochi was not good at playing the biwa Japanese lute, which should have been the family business of the Saionji Family, and during Kinmochi's time in office as prime minister, the Emperor Meiji said out of mischief to Kinmochi, "For the first time in a long while, I would like to listen to biwa Japanese lute," and therefore he was forced to play the biwa Japanese lute in dire distress together with the officials of Utaryo in the Imperial Household Ministry.
Mt. Hiei is a mountain that straddles the western part of Otsu City in Shiga Prefecture and the northeastern part of Kyoto City in Kyoto Prefecture.
Mt. Hiei is the name for the Soji ridge, which is formed by two peaks: Daihiei (848.3m) on the border between Otsu City and Kyoto City's Sakyo Ward; and Shimeigatake in Sakyo Ward (838m).
Daihiei's first-order triangulation point is located in Otsu City.
Next to Mt. Koya, it has long been an object of religious belief, flourishing with Enryaku-ji Temple and Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine on it.
It is part of the Higashiyama mountains (Kyoto Prefecture).
It is also known as Eizan, Hokurei, Tendaisan, Miyakofuji, etc.
Overview
Because of its location near the Kimon gate on the northeast side of Kyoto, Mt. Hiei is considered a castle guardian.
The Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters) calls Mt. Hiei 'Hienoyama', and records that Oyamakui no kami is enshrined on Hienoyama in Omi Province, and Narikabura is the object of worship.
Ever since Enryaku-ji Temple was founded on Hienoyama, Oyamakui no kami, as the god of the land, has been a guardian deity of the Tendai Sect and Enryaku-ji Temple; and a mountain-king sect based on him has spread in the area.
Also, it is the mountain where Enryaku-ji Temple's Thousand-Day Circumambulation Practice is done, including a pilgrimage to the shrines at the peak of Mt. Hiei, and to Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine at its foot.
Hiking is popular, and a famous trail begins at Shugakuin in Sakyo Ward of Kyoto City and goes up Kirarazaka hill; another one on the Shiga Prefecture side begins in Monzenmachi, Sakamoto (Otsu City), and goes up through Mudojidani valley.
The path on Kirarazaka hill has long been used by monks, monk soldiers and imperial messengers traveling between Kyoto and Enryaku-ji Temple, and is still visited by many hikers today.
The Tokaido Nature Trail passes through the mountain on the way from Otsu to Kyoto/Ohara.
Many tourists come on holidays, since they can reach the top via toll road, cable car, and ropeway.
There used to be a Mt. Hiei Amusement Park and a Mt. Hiei Artificial Ski Slope, but both were closed before 2002; the site of the ski slope is now a cosmos flower garden, and there is an art museum - Hiei Garden Museum - on the former location of the amusement park.
There was also a Forest Land Amusement Park in Yase, at the foot of the mountain on the Kyoto side, although that was closed on November 30, 2001, and a members-only resort hotel now stands in that location.
Daihiei and Shimeigatake
The survey findings from the Geographical Survey Institute show the eastern peak as Daihiei, the western peak as Shimeigatake, and both of them together as Mt. Hiei.
According to "Ten no Ki" (The Record of Survey), the first-order triangulation point on the eastern peak is called "Mt. Hiei".
Although this marker is located at the border between Otsu and Kyoto cities, it is inside Otsu City.
When one views Mt. Hiei from the Kyoto basin, it is difficult to see the Daihiei peak, so some think that Shimeigatake is the peak of Mt. Hiei.
The Keifuku Electric Railroad Eizan Ropeway has its Hiei Mountaintop Station placed on the Shimeigatake peak.
There are conflicting opinions as to the proper way to write and read "Shimeigatake"; the GSI lists Shimeigatake/Shimeidake, while "Place Names of Kyoto" lists Shimeigatake and Shimyo no Mine.
Mt. Hiei gets its alternate names, Mt. Tendai and Shimeigatake, from Mt. Tiantai and Mt. Siming, sacred mountains in the People's Republic of China that have associations with the Tendai Sect.
Geography
Mt. Hiei Viewed from the Side (left side)
The Tanba plateau and the Hira mountain region are separated by the Hanaore fault.
For this reason, it is considered to belong to the Hiei mountain region, or the Hiei Daigo mountain region.

The 53 stations of the Tokaido Road (Tokaido gojusan tsugi) can mean:
The 53 posting stations on the Tokaido Road, which connected Edo (Nihonbashi (Chuo Ward, Tokyo) and Kyoto (Sanjo Ohashi Bridge) during the Edo period.
To be explained in this section.
The ukiyoe works painted by Hiroshige UTAGAWA depicted 53 posting stations (or 55, including the starting/ending stations).

The 53 stations of the Tokaido Road (a game)
The "53 stations" of the Tokaido Road refers to 53 stations in 'Tokaido Road,' which is the major road running through the Tokaido region and is among five provinces and seven circuits(Gokishichido).
Many of the 53 stations are established in places where the scenery is beautiful, or in famous historic spots, and often served as the subjects of ukiyoe or waka/haiku.
Furthermore, when it is called 53 stations it refers to the road up to Kyoto, but when referring to the road up to Osaka the term 57 stations is used.
From here onward we will categorize them according to their respective provinces.
Serial numbers are used, starting at Shinagawa-juku Station.

Sanjo-Ohashi Bridge (Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture)
According to one theory, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA set the number of stations from Edo (Kanji characters with the same sound, 穢土, meaning unclean land) to Kyo (which means the land where Fugen Bosatsu (普賢菩薩) lives), based on a chapter from Kegon-kyo Sutra, in which Zenzai-doshi (善財童子) of 'Nyuhokkaibon (入法界品),' following the orders of Monju Bosatsu, achieved enlightenment at the place of Fugen Bosatsu, through 53 teachers.
As an extension of the Tokaido Road, the stations of the Kyokaido Road (Osaka Kaido Road) were established in 1619.
In some cases the stations of the Kyokaido Road are included and are collectively referred to as the 57 stations of the Tokaido Road.
Furthermore, when entering the Kyokaido Road from the Tokaido Road, Sanjo-Ohashi Bridge will not be crossed, and the route taken will turn southwest at Higechaya-oiwake (髭茶屋追分) (Oiwake-cho, Otsu City), so the station following Otsu-juku Station will be Fushimi-juku Station.
These will be categorized according to their respective provinces.
The first number is based on the country.
The second number is a serial number, starting with Shinagawa-juku Station.
54. Fushimi-juku Station (Kyo Kaido Road) (Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture)
55. Yodo-juku Station (Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture)
56. Hirakata-juku Station (Hirakata City, Osaka Prefecture)
57. Moriguchi-shuku Station (Moriguchi City, Osaka Prefecture)
Korai-bashi Bridge (Chuo Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture)
Note: It was formerly Kyobashi Bridge (a bridge over Neyagawa-river, which is located between the Chuo and Miyakojima Wards of Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture).
"The Pillow Book" is a zuihitsu essay (literally, "random jottings"), which is said to have been written by Sei Shonagon, a female writer who lived in the mid-Heian period.
The title was also written using Chinese characters such as '枕草紙' (Makurazoshi Notebook), '枕冊子' (Makura Sasshi), '枕双紙' (Makura soshi), and '春曙抄' (Shunsho-sho Commentary), and the oldest manuscript (called "maedabon" in Japanese), a copy of which was made in the Kamakura period, has a gold-lacquered casket with the Chinese characters "清少納言枕草子" (Sei Shonagon, The Pillow Book) written on it.
It was also called "Sei Shonagon ki."
Together with "The Tale of Genji," this book is considered one of the twin masterpieces of Heian literature, and it had a great influence on the Renga (linked verse), Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse), and Kanazoshi (old stories witten in the kana script) that followed.
Along with both "Hojo-ki (The Ten-Foot-Square Hut)," written by KAMO no Chomei, and "Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness)" written by Kenko YOSHIDA, it is called one of the three Japanese major lists, histories and satires.
Its writing style is extremely individualistic: there is no similar book except "Gizan-zassan (Gizan Collection)," compiled by Shangyin LI (courtesy name Yishan), a poet of the late Tang dynasty.
According to an afterword to the book, her motive for writing the book and the origin of the title came from the episode in which, when Naidaijin (minister of the center) FUJIWARA no Korechika presented to his younger sister FUJIWARA no Empress Teishi and Emperor Ichijo a bundle of paper, which was still expensive in those days, the Empress inquired, 'Emperor used the paper to copy "Shiki (Records of the Grand Historian),' what do you think we could write on this?" to which Sei Shonagon answered, 'it (the book) would be good to use as a pillow.'
She was granted the paper (such episode being based on Sankanbon (version of manuscript), and both incomplete and complete versions of Noinbon (version of manuscript) have similar episodes describing the response that "it (the book) would be good to use as a pillow)," but the Sakaibon and Maedabon (versions of the manuscript) don't contain this episode).
It is widely thought that the title 'The Pillow Book' is also based on the episode.
"A study of the Pillow Book" written by Kazuhiko HAYASHI mentions his own view and some other past scholars' names such as Keichu, Shinobu ORIKUCHI, and Kikan IKEDA.
The following are typical views about the meaning of "pillow":
― Bedding: a pun that suggests a pillow on the mattress (with Shiki reworded as Shikibuton (mattress)).
― Dictionary for the writer: There are many chapters in which Utamakura (a place famed in poetry), rules, and terms are listed.
― Memorandum: She kept the paper by her pillow for private jottings.
― Treasured book
― Irrelevant to anything
However, scholars have yet to reach a consensus.
Also, in the book of "Eiga monogatari (A Tale of Flowering Fortunes)," the term 'makura no soshi' as a common noun was used to describe the beautiful kasane (layering) colors.
According to the afterword, the first draft was written around 996, and Sachujo (guard of the Imperial Palace) MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa took the draft from the author's residence and brought it before the eyes of the world.
After that, she wrote continuously, and some records say the book was written around 1012.
Some lines of "The Pillow Book," as quoted from the old commentary "Shimei-sho Commentary of 'The Tale of Genji,'" don't exist in the surviving manuscript, which suggests that the writing process was complicated.
There are great differences between the existing manuscripts.
It consists of three volumes and takes the form of a collection of various writings.
It is a manuscript containing an okugaki (postscript) written in 1228 by a person called Bogyuguo, who seems to have been FUJIWARA no Sadaie.
It is 'clear writing' and is easy to understand, being considered the most similar to the original form.
It was divided into two groups by Kikan IKEDA.
Korui (first class) - The opening 70 chapters, which start with the line, 'The best time in spring is dawn,' are omitted, and instead the manuscript begins with the line, 'Comfortable thing.'
230 chapters
Book collection of Yomei paperback, book collection of Toshoryo, Shoryo Department, Imperial Household Agency, and book collection of the Tatamatsunomiya faamily
Otsurui (second class) - 300 chapters
Old book collection of Hamao YATOMI, book collection of Kariya City Library, old book collection of the Date family, old book collection of the KAJUJI Family, old book collection of Akika NAKAMURA, book collection of Koshido Bunko
The priest Noin was related by marriage to Sei Shonagon (one of his sisters was a wife of TACHIBANA no Norinaga, a son of Sei Shonagon), and seemed to have something to do with handing down the manuscript.
The date of the work has been traced back to the end of the Kamakura period.
After arguing which book is more authentic, it is now widely accepted that the original book of Noinbon is inferior to Sankanbon.
Two hundred and thirty chapters (excluding the first 70 chapters)
300 chapters
Ruisan form (a classified collection in book form)
Manuscript copied in the Muromachi period
The postscript says KIYOHARA no Shigekata/Edakata copied the book, whose owner was Doha, a secluded monk who lived in Sakai, and therefore the manuscript is called Sakaibon.
Two volumes
The book is missing chapters on diary and reminiscence.
Gokogoninbon (type of manuscript): 190 chapters
The postscript says Emperor Go-Kogon made a copy of the book.
Shinkanbon (a manuscript in the Emperor's own hand)
Ninety-five chapters
The above two types of manuscripts were integrated into a book.
Sakaibon in general refers to this.
Volume 1 consists of 107 chapters.
Volume 2 consists of 89 chapters.
Volume 3 consists of 102 chapters.
Volume 4 consists of 32 chapters.
Volume 5 might have been lost.
It takes Ruisan form.
There exists only one manuscript that has been handed down in the Maeda family of Kaga Province (the book collection of MAEDA-Ikutokukai).
It is preserved in a box of gold-lacquered craft, and on its surface are the characters "清少納言枕草子 (Sei Shonagon, The Pillow Book)" in gold incrustation.
It is an important cultural property.
It was copied during the early Kamakura period and is considered to be the oldest of all the manuscripts of "The Pillow Book."
Among them, the Sakaibon group Gokogoninbon was separately collected in two volumes of "Gunshoruiju (Japanese history book)," and three kinds of Sakaibon were collected in "Shinko Gunshoruiju (library)."
Additionally, Noinbon was used as a master copy in making the old plate of type in the early Edo period; therefore, it remained a dominant manuscript along with "The Pillow Book Bochu (marginal notes)" and "Shunsho-sho Commentary of The Pillow Book" (annotated by Kigin KITAMURA) until modern times.
However, in 1946, when Jutaro TANAKA (1917-1987) reevaluated the second class of Sankanbon, it came to be considered more important and was published more, being used as a textbook and read at school after the war.
Other existent manuscripts are seven chapters of "The Pillow Book Ekotoba (story in pictures)" made in the late Kamakura period, consisting of emaki (a picture scroll) with hakubyoga (ink line painting), and Sankanbon manuscript seems to have been used for the notes.
The second-class Sankanbon contains more than 300 independent chapters in total.
It consists of various types of writing: 'chapters of Ruiju' of 'Monowazukushi (enumerating the things in the same category),' as represented by the lists of things like 'Insects,' 'Flowering trees,' 'Dispiriting things,' 'Endearingly lovely things,' and 'Chapters of Zuiso (essay),' which is an observation of daily life and nature in the seasons, and 'chapters of reminiscence (chapters of a diary)' in which the author wrote about the life around Empress Teishi, whom she served in the Imperial Court.
However, some chapters are too obscure to be classified (for example the first chapter, entitled, 'The best time in spring is dawn,' is generally classified into the chapters of Zuiso, but some people disagree).
It was written in the plain vernacular using Hiragana (the Japanese cursive syllabary), and most of the chapters were written in a witty style, but sometimes sentimental lamentation appears reflecting the fall of the Michitaka FUJIWARA's family and unhappiness gone through by her majesty Empress Teishi.
The author's sophisticated taste was in harmony with a keen observation on things, generating the intellectual aesthetic world of 'wokashi (amusing or delightful)' in contrast with the emotional 'mono no aware (pathos)' of "The Tale of Genji."
Positive evaluation
In The Pillow Book, the author cherished humanity as well as nature; therefore, she accepted and formed them in each phase as various beauties (Sakuwo MEKATA).
Even in each chapter, various types of rich writing such as lists, essays or reminiscences are freely interwoven, like a flying horse soaring into the sky with a strand of associations called up one after another. (Boku HAGITANI)
Although it followed the conventional 'spring - flower -morning' type of link that was often seen in Kokinshu in those days, its use of the 'season-time' type of expression (such as 'the best time in spring is dawn'), which omitted the middle poetic element, was innovative, challenging as it did the rigid esthetic values held by readers who were familiar with poetic traditions. (Munetoshi FUJIMOTO)
She expressed her love and respect for Empress Teishi.
The author wrote it to console Empress Teishi, who felt depressed over the fall of the Michitaka family.
Therefore, it is natural that she didn't mention the fall of the Michitaka family (as above).
There are some chapters that seem like mere self-praise, but in them the author claimed that the Empress and the people around her received the Emperor's favor and led a life filled with aesthetic sentiment and exquisite taste, living in a world that was cut off from the politics of the time and disappointment. (Osamu UENO).
Negative evaluation
It is a representation of her shallowness trying to forget her original social rank and assimilate herself to the upper class. (Ken AKIYAMA)
(It is based on the fact that she didn't use polite expressions when she wrote, not only about her family but also about those who belonged to the upper classes.)
It is only 'a record of civilization in the inner palace,' and wasn't written by 'a private individual' (Joji ISHIDA).
Yoshinobu (Yoshihisa) TOKUGAWA was the 15th Seii Taishogun of the Edo Shogunate (held the position from December 5, 1866 to December 9, 1867, both in the old lunar calendar).
He was the only Shogun who did not work in Edo-jo Castle.
His rank awarded by the Imperial Court was Naidaijin (Inner Minister) Ju-ichii Kun-itto Koshaku.
He was a member of the House of Peers of Japan.
He served as the guardian (Shogun Kokenshoku) of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA; after Iemochi's death he assumed his position as the 15th Shogun of the Edo Shogunate.
After he returned his right to administer government to Emperor Meiji (Taisei Hokan), he worked aiming to unite the nobles and samurai (Kobu Gattai); however, during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi that took place after the Restoration of Imperial Rule (Osei Fukko), he left the Shogunate army behind at Osaka-jo Castle and returned to Edo-jo Castle; thereafter, he received a subjugation order from the Imperial Court and entered into disciplinary confinement which led to the Bloodless Surrender of Edo-jo Castle.
After being freed from the disciplinary confinement, he immersed himself in his hobbies; he was awarded the title of Koshaku and lived into the Taisho Period.
The name "Yoshinobu" is also popularly read as "Keiki" (Yusoku-yomi, the way of pronouncing in the Chinese-derived reading, so as not to directly pronounce the real name of the respectable person in the Japanese reading).
There is a record among official documents of the Edo Shogunate that during his tenure as the Shogun his name was also read as "Yoshihisa".
There are also records of his name written as "Yoshihisa" with his own signature using Roman letters, and [his name printed as "Yoshihisa"] in newspapers in English.
He is most often called "Yoshinobu" in his homeland of Mito, but he is often called "Keiki" in Shizuoka, where he spent the rest of his life.
According to those who knew him in his lifetime, Yoshinobu himself liked to be called "Keiki-sama", and he called himself "Keiki" in a telegraph sent to his younger brother, Akitake TOKUGAWA.
Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA, who was Yoshinobu's heir, was also called "Keikyu-sama" from those around him.
The use of the two names "Keiki-sama" and "Keiki-san" has been confirmed, and even though it seems to have become uncommon in the modern days, the use of "Keiki-san" is not limited to Shizuoka but is confirmed in various regions; in both cases the name is often used with much affection.
Though Ryotaro SHIBA commented that "the name 'Keiki' was used quite often among those associated with the former Shogunate", the use of the name "Keiki" was also confirmed among those related to Higo-han Clan who worked toward the fall of the Shogunate; there is a possibility that he was widely yet secretly respected and admired.
He was born at the Mito-han Clan residence of Koishikawa in Edo, as the seventh son of the ninth chief [of Mito-han Clan], Nariaki TOKUGAWA on September 29, 1837.
His mother was [his father's] legitimate wife, Princess Yoshiko (he was the first Shogun since the third Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA whose biological mother was the father's legitimate wife.
However, although Iemitsu's biological mother is officially known as the father Hidetada's legitimate wife, Ogo no Kata, but one theory suggests that his biological mother was Kasuga no Tsubone).
His childhood name was Shichiromaro.
Based on Nariaki's educational policy, "a boy should be educated in his home domain" Yoshinobu moved to Mito at the age of seven months and spent most of his time there until he succeeded to the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa Family, during which time he was educated and taught martial arts by Seishisai AIZAWA.
Yoshinobu's intelligence was noted early; at first, instead of sending him to another family for adoption, Nariaki planned to keep him by his eldest son and heir, Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA's side.
On August 1, 1847, the Shogunate gave a secret order to designate Shichiromaro of Mito-han Clan as the heir to the Hitotsubashi Family, one of the three branches of the Tokugawa-han Clan (Gosankyo).
Accepting this order, Shichiromaro succeeded to the Hitotsubashi Family on September 1; in December, he received Henki (one character of Shogun's name: 慶) from the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi (家慶) TOKUGAWA and changed his name to Yoshinobu (慶喜).
Considering Yoshinobu as a strong candidate as the heir to the Shogun, Ieyoshi visited the Hitotsubashi Residence often, but he abandoned this idea after accepting Roju Masahiro ABE's admonishing advice.
During the disorder caused by the Arrival of the Black Ships, Shogun Ieyoshi died in 1853; his heir, the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA, had poor health with no prospect of having his own son, and therefore the issue of "who would become the Shogun's heir" arose (Issue of Shogun's Heir).
There was an opposition between the Hitotsubashi-party that included Nariaki, Masahiro ABE and the Chief of Satsuma-han Clan, Nariakira SHIMAZU, who recommended Yoshinobu, and the Nanki-party primarily consisting of the Chief of Hikone-han Clan, Naosuke II, and the Ooku members headed by Iesada's birth-mother, Honjuin, who recommended the Chief of Kii-han Clan, Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA.
The Hitotsubashi-party executed political maneuvers such as sending into Ooku Nariakira SHIMAZU's adopted daughter, Tenshoin, as Shogun's wife (Midaidokoro), but after the death of Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU, its power weakened; Naosuke II who became Tairo in 1858 settled on "Shogun's heir as Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA" through arbitration.
In the same year, Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without the Emperor's permission.
Yoshinobu, along with Nariaki and the Chief of Fukui-han Clan, Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA, made an unexpected visit to the [Edo-jo] castle and closely interrogated Naosuke, but in tern, he was questioned on his offense of making an unexpected visit to the castle; he was ordered to retire and was given a disciplinary confinement in the following year (1859) (Ansei Purge).
Yoshinobu himself seemed to be uninterested in becoming the heir to the Shogun and he sent a letter to Nariaki whose content indicated "I appreciate your efforts but I'd rather not become the Shogun than to make mistakes after becoming the Shogun."
He was relieved from his disciplinary confinement in 1860.
In 1862, guarded by the Satsuma-han Clan army under the command of Hisamitsu SHIMAZU, the Emperor's messenger, Shigetomi OHARA, entered Edo and delivered Emperor Komei's order to "promote Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA to the Shogun's guardian (Shogun Kokenshoku) and Shungaku (Yoshinaga) MATSUDAIRA to Tairo."
On July 6, the Shogunate ordered Yoshinobu to be the Shogun's guardian (Shogun Kokenshoku) and Shungaku to be the Shogunal Prime Minister (Seiji Sosaishoku).
Yoshinobu and Shungaku directed a reform of the Shogunate known as the Bunkyu Reform that included installation of The Office of Kyoto Protector (Kyoto Shugoshoku) and relaxation of Sankin Kotai requirement.
In 1863, he went to Kyoto as Iemochi TOKUGAWA's harbinger, and he endeavored to negotiate with the members of the Imperial Court who urged the execution of Joi (expulsion of foreigners from Japan).
Upon Emperor Komei's visit to Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the execution of Joi, if Iemochi received Setto (Emperor's sword that symbolically authorizes the Shogun to take charge of the upcoming battle on behalf of the Emperor) from the Emperor, he would have no choice but to execute Joi; Yoshinobu quickly made Iemochi cancel the audience [with the Emperor] by saying that Iemochi had a cold and a fever (pretended illness).
When the Sonno Joi party (the anti-foreigner Royalists) centered around the Choshu-han Clan lost their case upon the political change on August 18, Yoshinobu went to Kyoto again in order to participate in a meeting jointly held by the party trying to unite the nobles and samurai (Kobu Gattai) and the party assisting the Shogunate (Sabaku).
However, when no agreement was reached, he used a bold method of negotiation; he intentionally got drunk at a banquet with Prince Kuni Asahiko and reviled at Munenari DATE, Shungaku MATSUDAIRA and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU, and furthermore, violently said to Nakagawa no Miya, "how much is SHIMAZU paying you!" so as to breakdown their organization.
Thereafter, he remained in Kyoto and he was appointed to Kinri Goshuei Sotoku (Head of the Imperial Palace/Emperor's Protector); together with the Protector (Shugoshoku) Katamori MATSUDAIRA (Aizu-han Clan) and Kyoto Shoshidai Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA (Chief of Kuwana-han Clan) regulated the nobles and those loyal to the Emperor (Ichi-Kai-So (Hitotsubashi-Aizu-Kuwana) structure).
During the Tenguto War he showed his cruelty by slashing his supporters such as Kounsai TAKEDA and the vassals of his home domain of Mito.
At the Kinmon Rebellion in 1864 he led the Shogunate army and he himself attacked the Choshu army that had occupied the Takatsukasa Residence.
After the First Subjugation of Choshu that followed, he made every effort to secure the Emperor's permission on the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the Unites States and Japan that had been left unauthorized by the Emperor; he succeeded in securing the Emperor's authorization albeit with provisos.
At the Second Subjugation of Choshu in 1866, Yoshinobu suppressed interferences from Satsuma-han Clan and received a direct order from the Emperor to subjugate Choshu.
However, because of the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance (Saccho Alliance), Satsuma-han Clan refused to send its army and consequently the Shogunate army had to retreat.
During the Second Subjugation of Choshu, Shogun Iemochi passed away at Osaka-jo Castle on July 20.
Yoshinobu appealed to the Imperial Court to make an official announcement of truce by the Emperor and he succeeded in concluding an armistice treaty.
He was recommended to be Iemochi's successor but Yoshinobu firmly declined.
He succeeded to the Tokugawa Shogun Family on Aug. 20 but he continued to refuse to assume his position as the Shogun.
Since then the roju (Shogun's political advisor) and others sincerely requested him to become the Shogun, but he still did not accept the request; he finally assumed his position as the Shogun on December 5, after accepting (Emperor Komei's) direct order to become the Shogun.
By becoming the Shogun as a favor to others he aimed to manipulate politics to his advantage.
Through the French Minister Leon Roches, he received 2.4 million dollars from France and founded Yokosuka Ironworks, a shipyard, and a ship repair dock, and he also led a revolution in the military system by inviting a group of military advisors headed by Jules Brunet.
He also sent his biological younger brother, Akitake TOKUGAWA, to the Paris Exposition and encouraged the younger members of the Shogunate vassals to study in Europe.
On the matter of opening of port of Hyogo, he tenaciously persuaded the Imperial Court and obtained the Emperor's permission.
Yoshinobu anticipated a secret order to Saccho (Satsuma and Choshu -han Clans) from the Emperor to destroy the Shogunate, and on Oct. 14, 1867, he (as a preemptive measure) suggested to the Imperial Court that he would return his political power to the Emperor; his request was accepted by the Emperor on the 15th, the following day (Taisei Hokan).
It is said that he judged the Imperial Court at the time to have no capability to administer government, and he therefore sought continuation of Tokugawa Family's political power by leading the Session of Clan Chiefs.
However, because of the anti-Shogunate activists Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA's scheme, there was a command to revive the political power of the Imperial Court in December, and Yoshinobu was ordered "Jikan Nochi" (to resign from his position as Naidaijin and surrender the Tokugawa territory).
In order to avoid confrontations Yoshinobu retreated to Osaka-jo Castle, assembled the ambassadors from various foreign countries and asserted the legitimacy of Tokugawa; furthermore, he appealed to the Imperial Court and had the Jikan Nochi modified to more moderate terms.
However, in response to the provocation caused by Satsuma-han Clan in the city of Edo in 1868 he mobilized his army and blockaded Kyoto using the armies of Aizu and Kuwana-han Clans.
Nevertheless, at the Battle of Toba Fushimi that broke out on January 3, even though the military force was holding up adequately, he judged that the former Shogunate army was at a disadvantage; he abandoned his army and retreated to Edo-jo Castle aboard warship Kaiyo Maru.
Soon an order was issued to subjugate Yoshinobu as the enemy of the Imperial Court, and the Imperial Army led by General Prince Arisugawa Taruhito set off to the east.
Yoshinobu suppressed the resistance party led by Tadamasa OGURI and asserted to comply with the order.
In February, he entrusted Kaishu KATSU to take control of the situation and entered into a disciplinary confinement at Daiji-in located in Kan'ei-ji Temple in Ueno.
Furthermore, he passed on the estate of Tokugawa-Soke (the main branch of Tokugawa Family) to his adopted son Kamenosuke TAYASU (future Iesato TOKUGAWA).
The negotiation between Katsu and the Staff Officer of the Imperial Army, Takamori SAIGO, reached an agreement and Bloodless Surrender of Edo-jo Castle took place; Yoshinobu was moved to Mito and he continued his disciplinary confinement in a room within Kodokan of [Mito] Han (Domain) School.
In July, [the entire] Tokugawa family was relocated to Sunpu.

He was a member of House of Peers (Japan) (~ December, 1910)
1908
On April 30, his contributions to Taisei Hokan were recognized and he was awarded Kun-itto Kyokujitsu Daijusho from the Meiji Government.
He retired on December 8.
He died (at 4:10 A.M.) on November, 22, 1913.
On the same day, he was awarded Kyokujitsu Toka Daijusho.
As far as education and studying of martial arts are concerned, he was born and raised under the very best circumstance; among many forms of martial arts he was especially interested in and was an expert in shuriken (dirk-throwing).
Even after Taisei Hokan, he practiced throwing the shuriken every day until he was sweating, and he is counted as one of the most famous persons among the shuriken experts.
He tossed about a lot in bed in his sleep, and his father, Nariaki TOKUGAWA, thought that this would be a problem when he became the heir to the Tokugawa Family; in order to correct this, razor blades were planted into his pillow (this was done just to scare him, and in reality the razor blades were removed after he had fallen asleep so as to prevent any injuries).
On the other hand, there is an anecdote that in his adulthood he slept with his wife and a concubine so that the three of them formed the letter "Y" as a measure against assassination attempts.
There is supposed to be a photograph of Yoshinobu from his early childhood, but because cameras were probably not yet introduced to Japan at that time, it is doubtful that the photograph is that of Yoshinobu.
Yoshinobu visited Iemochi when he fell ill, and at this occasion it is said that they had a normal conversation.
His extraordinary talent was well known, and his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA's confidant, Tatewaki AJIMA, commented on him as "someone who will purify the Tokugawa Family line"; he singly shouldered the expectation of restoring the Shogunate's authority, and when his highly touted tenure as the Shogun began, his brilliance was praised as "the return of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA".
Yoshinobu's intelligence was well known even among the Anti-Shogunate Party, and Takayoshi KIDO of Choshu-han Clan in particular was on guard saying, "Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI's daring and intelligent strategy cannot be underestimated.
It is like seeing the return of Ieyasu."
Regarding the decision on Taisei Hokan, Ryoma SAKAMOTO said, "My respected Shogun, I wonder what you are feeling in your heart today.
I praise how you made the [difficult] decision, I praise how you made the [difficult] decision.
I make a vow to dedicate my life to the Lord. " Ryoma highly praised Yoshinobu and he even considered giving Yoshinobu a position as Assistant Kanpaku in the New Government.
However, Yoshinobu did not learn about the existence of Ryoma until the Meiji era (after Ryoma's death).
Yoshinobu was not the only person who did not know about Ryoma; Ryoma's fame in his life time was very much smaller than that after the Meiji Restoration.
When he lost the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and retreated to Edo, his enemies highly criticized him for "running away in the face of the enemy".
There were people who made fun of Yoshinobu for being a spineless coward, pointing out that even though he left behind Ieyasu's umajirushi (sign belonging to the clan general/chief and used in a battle) of golden fan, he always had his beloved concubine with him.
However, there is a view that Yoshinobu had no choice [but to retreat] because at that time it was necessary to suppress military revolts in Edo as well as in Musashi Province, and because Yoshinobu became the Imperial Court's enemy, various clans were alienating themselves one after another from the Shogunate; thus, even if he was able to protect Osaka-jo Castle, a long-term battle had to be avoided in order to prevent interventions from foreign countries.
Because he entered Kan'ei-ji Temple for disciplinary confinement as soon as the New Government designated him as the Imperial Court's enemy, he was considered as a reasonable man who respected the Emperor and the Imperial Court (perhaps this was due to the teaching of Mito-han [Clan] that highly respected the Emperor and also to the fact that his mother was from the Imperial Family); however, on the other hand, he was also called weak-kneed because as the lord of his people, he was not able to stand resolutely in the face of the enemy.
Because of his compliance with the disciplinary confinement and the Bloodless Transfer of Edo-jo Castle, the administrative power was transferred as a result of almost a bloodless revolution; he contributed greatly to the Restoration and ensuring of independency of modern Japan.
Businessman Eiichi SHIBUSAWA was a vassal appointed during [Yoshinobu's] tenure as the head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa Family, and they kept their contact even after the Meiji Restoration.
In Yoshinobu's last years, SHIBUSAWA aimed to edit Yoshinobu's biography; he persuaded unwilling Yoshinobu and started "Sekimukai" meetings to hear stories directly from Yoshinobu.
A collection of these stories is called "Sekimukai Hikki".
In one of the chapters which was recorded in the form of a discussion, one can see what Yoshinobu's voice, so to speak, was like.
He used his age as an excuse to evade unpalatable questions and he let out his true feelings by saying, "I didn't really like Hisamitsu SHIMAZU" and "Naomasa NABESHIMA was a cunning fellow"; from these comments, one can see his personality and what he was feeling at that time.
After Yoshinobu's death "Tokugawa Yoshinobu-ko Den" was completed based on these materials.
In order to show his gratitude to Emperor Meiji who pardoned Yoshinobu from being the enemy of the Imperial Court and gave him the title of Koshaku, the highest rank of the peers, Yoshinobu directed in his will that his funeral be conducted in the Shinto style rather than the Buddhist style.
Therefore, Yoshinobu's grave is neither in the Tokugawa Family graveyard of his family temple Zojo-ji Temple or the Tokugawa Family graveyard at Kan'ei-ji Temple; instead, a tumulus similar to that of the Imperial Family was built in Yanaka Cemetery.
He did so because he was moved by the fact that Emperor Komei's tomb was very simple ("Tokugawa Yoshinobu-ko Den").
After his pardon, Yoshinobu enjoyed a relaxed life without any regards to his former vassals who devoted their lives to him; on this, Roju Katsukiyo ITAKURA later commented, "I regret working together with Yoshinobu".
Even though he has an image of being a spineless coward, because he "ran away in the face of his enemy" during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, there has recently been a focus on his attempt at constructing a new, modern political system after Taisei Hokan, and there is a movement to re-evaluate his contributions including airing of "TOKUGAWA Yoshinobu" (an NHK Taiga Drama).
As with his father, Nariaki, he liked pork from Satsuma-han Clan and he was called Butaichi-sama (meaning Hitotsubashi-sama who likes pork).
He was interested in items of western culture, and in his later years he liked to eat bread and drink milk and he enjoyed his interests in photography, fishing, riding the bicycle, microscopy and craft (embroidery). During his tenure as the Shogun, he learned French from Amane NISHI but he gave up on this.
He was well know as a photographer, but his techniques in photography seemed to have been mediocre.
He often submitted his photographs to photography magazines, but his photographs were hardly ever printed in the magazines.
His great grandchild, Yoshitomo TOKUGAWA, is a freelance photographer; he discovered photographs stored in the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Family including the ones taken by Yoshinobu and he published the photo album after organizing and editing them.
Yoshinobu's biological younger brother, Akitake TOKUGAWA, was his friend who shared his hobbies in his life.
He married Mikako ICHIJO (name changed to Mikako after the Meiji Restoration) on December 3, 1855.
The first daughter (Keikoin) between Mika was born on July 16, 1858 but she soon died on July 20.
Afterwards, there were no more children between Mika; the 10 boys and 11 girls born during the Meiji era were children born between his two concubines.
Some of these children include the seventh son, Yoshihisa, who became a Koshaku and succeeded to the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Family, tenth son, Kuwashi, who married into Kaishu KATSU's family and ninth daughter, Tsuneko, who became Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu.
Some of Yoshihisa's children include Yoshimitsu TOKUGAWA and Princess Kikuko who married Prince Takamatsu Nobuhito.

The JR Nara Line is a railway line (arterial line) of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) that runs between Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture) in Kizugawa City, Kyoto Prefecture, and Kyoto Station in the Shimogyo Ward of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
The entire rail line is included in the section covering the metropolitan area and its suburbs.
Although the Nara Line officially starts at Kizu Station because it is historically a branch line of the Kansai Main Line, outbound trains (odd-numbered trains) run from Kyoto to Kizu and inbound trains (even-numbered trains) run in the opposite direction.
Unless otherwise specified, the descriptions are given according to the outbound direction from Kyoto to Kizu, except for in the track data section.
The line's own color is brown, which has been chosen to represent 'a classic, sophisticated impression suitable for connections between two historic cities.'
Administration (type of business): West Japan Railway Company (Railway Business Operator)
Track length (operating kilometers): 34.7 km
Track gauge: 1067 mm
Number of stations: 19 (including the stations at both ends of the track section)
Double-track section: Shinden Station - Uji Station; JR-Fujinomori Station - Kyoto Station
Electrified section: The entire rail line is electrified (DC 1500V).
Block (railway): automatic block system (double-track section), single-track automatic block system (single-track section)
Safety equipment: ATS (Automatic Train Stop system)
Operation direction center: Shin-Osaka integrated direction center
Maximum speed: 110 km/h (double-track section), 95 km/h (single-track section)
All stations except Kizu Station are managed by the Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company, while the Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka branch of the West Japan Railway Company.
The line between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station is called the Nara Line, but the entire line lies within Kyoto Prefecture, not in Nara Prefecture.
This is because, initially, the Nara Line was built by Nara Railways between Kyoto Station and Nara Station, but Kizu Station and other stations south of Kizu Station were separated from the Nara Line in order to be part of a route between Osaka and Nagoya after Nara Railways was merged into Kansai Railways.
However, trains run from Kizu Station to Nara Station in Nara Prefecture through the Kansai Main Line (Yamatoji Line).
JR West established popular names (JR Kyoto Line, JR Kobe Line or the like) for the lines in the Urban Network with the revision of March 13, 1988, but a popular name was not given to the Nara Line.
The Nara Line is also referred to as the 'JR Nara Line' in order to distinguish it from the Kintetsu Nara Line of Kintetsu Corporation.
The Nara Line was referred to as the 'JNR Nara Line' in the era of Japan National Railways (JNR), the former JR, and the information board included the English notation 'JNR.'
The Kintetsu Nara Line competes with the Yamatoji Line between Nanba and Nara, whereas the JR Nara Line competes with the Kintetsu Kyoto Line.
While many trains used to run on the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line (both of which run parallel to the Nara Line), the Nara Line was only electrified toward the end of JNR in 1984; consequently, it remained just a small local line on which the JNR/JR Commuter Train Series 105 (comprising two cars or the like) ran for some time, even after electrification, until the privatization of the JNR.
However, after the foundation of JR West and the Nara Line's incorporation into the Urban Network, the improvement of transportation services was quickly achieved with, for example, trains comprised of four cars (some comprised of six cars), double-tracked in part, or with increased numbers of trains, including rapid services such as the 'Miyakoji Rapid Service.'
Today, the Nara Line is characterized by the access it offers to sightseeing areas such as Byodo-in Temple in Uji City, or by a commuter line for passengers from the southern part of the Kyoto Prefecture, such as Joyo City.
However, trains go around toward the east between Momoyama Station and Shinden Station and run the edge of the central part of town in Joyo or to the south of Joyo; thus the regional and transportation gaps between the Nara Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line remain.
Rolling stock owned by the Osaka branch for the Nara rail yard is used, but station facilities are maintained by the Kyoto branch (except for Kizu Station).
The following commuter passes can be used at all stations on this line: J-THRU/ICOCA; Suica, which is offered by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East); TOICA, which is offered by the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central); and PiTaPa, which is offered by the Surutto Kansai Association.
Simple ticket gates are used at Joyo Station or stations to the south of Joyo Station, as some unmanned stations still exist.
After the limited express 'Kuroshio' connecting Kyoto Station with Wakayama Station via the Nara, Sakurai and Wakayama lines ceased operation in 1984, only the local trains ran until 1991 (except for the temporary operation of a special limited express), but now there are four types of trains: the Miyakoji Rapid Service, the rapid service, the trains classified by operation and section, and the local train.
The Miyakoji Rapid Service--the fastest train on the Nara Line--runs mainly during the day.
The train basically runs every 30 minutes and variously connects with the local trains at Uji Station.
The public gave this train the nickname 'Miyakoji rapid train' before it went into operation.
Not only Japanese people but also foreign visitors use the Miyakoji Rapid Service as a train connecting Kyoto with Nara, both of which are sightseeing destinations.
The cars are all from the JR Suburban Train Series 221, which comprises either four or six cars.
The maximum train speed is 110 km/h in double-track sections, or 95 km/h in other sections.
The standard travel times are approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto to Nara and about 47 minutes from Nara to Kyoto.
A train bound for Kyoto stops at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station for about two minutes and passes the Miyakoji Rapid Service bound for Nara, thus making a slight difference between the travel times of the inbound train and outbound train.
During the New Year holiday the train temporarily stops at Inari Station for visitors to Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine.
History
March 3, 2001: Operations began.
March 15, 2003: The train began making stops at Tofuku-ji Station and Tamamizu Station through a revision of the schedule.
The rapid service runs during the morning and evening rush periods.
It stops at JR-Ogura Station and Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture), through which the 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' passes.
The cars used are all from the JR Suburban Train Series 221, which comprises either four or six cars.
The train basically runs every 30 minutes and variously connects with the local train at the Uji Station.
Like the Miyakoji Rapid Service, the rapid service passes through Narayama Station, at which the rapid train on the Yamatoji Line stops.
Before the 'Miyakoji rapid train' came into operation in March 2001, the rapid train had stopped at Kyoto, Uji, Joyo (except at the beginning), Kizu and Nara stations, employing the JNR/JR Suburban Train Series 117 for its cars; since then, however, this series has not been used on the Nara Line.
Some rapid service trains run through to the Yamatoji Line in the morning and evening due to the schedule of operation.
The regional rapid service runs mainly in the morning and nighttime hours.
Initially, the operation was limited to weekdays, but with the schedule revision of March 18, 2006 it was changed to Saturdays and holidays in addition to weekdays.
The regional rapid service stops at every station between Uji Station and Nara Station, while some regional rapid services bound for Kizu used to pass the local train at Uji Station in the late evening, etc., due to the schedule; however, based on the current schedule, the regional rapid service doesn't pass the local train before reaching the arrival station.
All regional rapid services employ the JR Suburban Train Series 221, except that one regional rapid service leaving Kyoto Station between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Saturdays and holidays employs the JNR/JR Commuter Train Series 103.
Due to the operation schedule, some regional rapid services run through from the Yamatoji Line during the morning rush period.
The regional rapid service on the Nara Line formerly used orange letters as the Line's own color, but it was the same color as the one used for the 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' and the rapid service so as to distinguish the regional rapid service on the Nara Line from that of the Yamatoji Line. However, in March 2008, with the replacement of signs along with the revision of the schedule, a sign for the regional rapid service was changed to include green letters, whereby the use of the line color was stopped.
At the Kamikoma Station or stations to the north of Kamikoma Station, purple letters are used on the timetable boards.
The local train runs between Kyoto Station, Uji Station, Joyo Station and Nara Station.
The train runs every 15 minutes during the day between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station, and every 30 minutes between Joyo Station and Kizu Station.
Basically, the cars are from the JNR/JR Commuter Train Series 103, but some are from the JR Suburban Train Series 221.
Due to the schedule, some local trains go through to the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late evening.
Formerly, some local trains would go through to the Sakurai Line, but with the schedule revision of September 4, 1994, the Nara and Sakurai lines were divided.
Formerly, a limited express ran on the Nara Line as a special train.
A limited express which had the nickname 'Kuroshio XX' from 1987 to 1988 and 'Kuroshio XX' from 1988 to 1989, the JNR/JR Limited Express Series 381ran between Kyoto Station and Shirahama Station via the Kansai Main Line, the Kansai Main Line Hanwa Freight Line and the Hanwa Line.
The Kinki edition of the Yomiuri Shinbun newspaper announced on January 6, 1998 that a limited express comprising the JNR/JR Limited Express Series 381 would begin operating (as a regular train) on the Nara Line in about 2001, but eventually the plan was canceled.
The Miyakoji leisure train ran between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station (the Miyakoji Rapid Service ran for the section between Kyoto Station and Nara Station) for some time, but now there is no train excluding a special train going through to the Sakurai Line.
The Uji-gawa River fireworks display (nearest stop: Uji Station) is held in mid-August, when the special schedule is introduced to secure sufficient transport capacity before 4 p.m. to the end; after 4 p.m., only the local trains run between Kyoto Station and Uji Station at intervals of approximately 10 minutes.
Kizu Station is the arrival and departure station of some local trains.
When the Nara Line was a single track, a special schedule was adopted during the New Year holidays, according to which the rapid train stopped at every station between Kyoto Station and Uji Station, and the number of trains traveling to Uji Station was increased.
During some New Year holidays the train would arrive at and depart from Momoyama Station.
In about 1992 (mainly on Saturdays and holidays) a through train to the Sakurai Line bound for Tenri Station ran once an hour by extending its regular rapid service.
Occasionally, trains reserved for groups enter the Nara Line from around the country.
During the Tenrikyo Autumn Grand Service held every October 26, particularly, the through train denoted as a 'train reserved for groups: Tenrikyo transportation train' runs from Kyoto Station to Kizu Station via the Nara Line, to Nara Station via the Yamatoji Line, and to Tenri Station via the Sakurai Line.
All cars belong to the Nara rail yard.
JR Suburban Train Series 221
The Nara Line shares the JR Suburban Train Series 221 (comprising two, four or six cars) with the Yamatoji Line, the Osaka Loop Line, etc.
The JR Suburban Train Series 221 comprising either four or six cars is used mainly for the 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' and the 'Rapid Service,' while the one comprising four cars mainly enters the Nara Line.
The JR Suburban Train Series 221 (comprising two cars joining two other cars) runs according to the holiday schedule.
JNR/JR Commuter Train Series 103
The JNR/JR Commuter Train Series 103 (comprising four cars) is used on the Nara Line for the local train, while the one comprising eight cars (four joining four other cars) is used on the Osaka Loop Line and on the Yamatoji Line for the regional rapid service during the rush hours.
Part of the rolling stock is replaced with stock transferred from the Osaka Loop Line's Morinomiya rail yard.
The line connecting Kyoto, Kizu and Nara was opened by the Nara Electric Railway, and initially trains ran the same route as the current Kintetsu Kyoto Line between Kyoto and Momoyama.
In 1921, the Tokaido Main Line between Baba (currently Zeze) Station and Kyoto Station was switched to the current line via the Higashiyama tunnel; and on the same day the old Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station and Inari Station and a new line between Inari Station and Momoyama Station came to serve as the Nara Line, whereby the line between Kyoto Station and Fushimi Station was abolished and the line between Fushimi Station and Momoyama Station was made a freight line.
Later, the land after the line between the Kyoto Station and the Fushimi Station was sold to the Nara Electric Railway, a predecessor of the Kintetsu Kyoto Line.

The Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station and Inari Station (1.8M ≒ 2.90 km) was incorporated into the Nara Line.
The new line between Inari Station and Momoyama Station（2.6M ≒ 4.18 km) was opened.
April 1, 1922: The Ujigawa temporary signal box (宇治川仮信号所) was changed to the Ujigawa temporary signal station (宇治川仮信号場).
February 13, 1926: Aodani-Bairin temporary train station was opened.
April 1: The Ujigawa temporary signal station was abolished.
September 3, 1928: The freight branch line between Momoyama Station and Fushimi Station was abolished.
Fushimi Station was abolished.
April 1, 1930: The operating distance was changed to be given in meters from miles (e.g., from 21.6M to 34.7 km).

October 1, 1984: The line between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station (to Nara Station) became electrified.
The JNR/JR Commuter Train Series 105 and the JNR/JR Suburban Train Series 113 began operating.
The limited express 'Kinokawa' (between Kyoto Station and Wakayama Station via the Nara, Sakurai and Wakayama lines) was abolished.
April 1, 1987: The Japan National Railways was split up and privatized to form the JR Group, as a result of which the JR Nara Line became part of the West Japan Railway Company.
The Japan Freight Railway Company became a railway business operator for every line.
March 16, 1991: The rapid service comprising the JNR/JR Suburban Train Series 117 began operating.
October 22, 1992: Rokujizo Station was opened.
The rapid service began making stops at Joyo Station.

April 30: The ATS-P was introduced between Kyoto Station and Obaku Station.
The single-track sections between JR-Fujinomori and Uji stations, and between Shinden and Kizu stations, remain under discussion, but no specific plan has been established.
Moreover, the acquisition of land along National Route 24 between JR-Fujinomori Station and Momoyama Station, and along the Keihan Uji Line between Kohata Station and Uji Station (near Obaku Station) is particularly difficult.
Due to a shortage of budget, no further plan will proceed before the double-tracking of the entire Sagano Line (between the Sanin Main Line Kyoto Station and Sonobe Station) is completed.
At the Council for Transportation in the Kinki region, a plan for operation of the Nara Line through to the Tokaido Main Line (JR Kyoto Line) in the future is under discussion (there was once an overnight service from the late evening of December 31 to the early morning of January 1).
Uji City is planning to build a new station between Obaku Station and Uji Station.
There is no intermediate station under direct control, except for Rokujizo Station and Uji Station (JR West).
The distance of operation (in kilometers) from Kyoto Station is placed in parentheses.

The Keiji Bypass is the bypass of a national highway that extends from Kusatsu City in Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama Town, Kuse-gun in Kyoto Prefecture.
It is a planning route designated as a local high-standard highway.
The first description below refers to a toll road called the Keiji Bypass and the second refers to a bypass joining National Highways 1 and 24 that is also called the Keiji Bypass.
Its toll road section is integrated in the Meishin Expressway to connect the Ritto Interchange (in the direction of Nagoya City) and the Suita Interchange (in the direction of Osaka City) of the Meishin Expressway by passing round the urban areas of Otsu City and Kyoto City.
In terms of laws, the section from the Seta-higashi Interchange to the Kumiyamayodo Interchange, being part of the national highways 1 and 478, is a regional high-standard road; the Kumiyamayodo Interchange to Oyamazaki Junction, a part of National Highway 478, is a high-standard highway designated by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation (a national highway only for vehicles) (Kyoto-daini-soto-kanjo-doro Belt Line of the Kyoto jukan-jidoushdo Expressway); and the section from Oyamazaki Junction to Kumiyamyodo Interchange is a national express highway (a section called the Keiji Bypass of the Chuo Jidosha-do National Expressway).
To reduce congestion on the Meishin Expressway and respond to the need for a road network that could serve as a radial road and belt line in Kyoto City, the construction of the Kyoto-daini-soto-kanjo-doro Belt Line was subsequently planned to connect the Kyoto-Tanba-doro (formerly the bypass of National Highway 9) to the Keiji Bypass.
The Kyoto Jukan-Jidoshado Expressway and the Kyoto-daini-soto-kanjo-doro Belt Line were designated as National Highway 478, and their construction has been continuously promoted.
On traffic signs, the section between the Seta-Higashi Junction and the Oyamazaki Junction is identified as the Keiji Bypass so as to make it easier for drivers to understand the signs.
Whichever route is chosen--the Meishin Expressway or the Keiji Bypass--the same toll and ETC commuter discount service apply.
The Keiji Bypass here means the service line known as such (between Seta-Higashi Interchange and Oyamazaki Junction) unless otherwise specified.

The Uji Tunnel of this section is, at 4,313 meters, the longest on the National Highway; lane changes are prohibited in the tunnel except between the area 500 meters short of the Kasatori Interchange and the Ujihigashi Interchange.
A well-known Japanese movie called "Odoru Daisosasen The MOVIE 2: Block up the Rainbow Bridge" was filmed around the Kumiyama Junction before it was opened.
Because less distance is traveled between the Seta-higashi Junction and the Oyamazaki Interchange/Junction if drivers take the Keiji Bypass instead of the Meishin Highway, a driver driving at the speed limit on the Keiji Bypass will arrive at their destination more quickly than a driver driving at the speed limit on the Meishin Highway.
The Keiji Bypass has no rest service areas or other such facilities, so it's less congested than the Meishin Expressway (which has two rest areas: Otsu Rest Area and Katsuragawa Rest Area between Setahigashi and Oyamazaki.)
However, due to the design of both the Seto-higashia and Oyamazaki junctions, which require ramps (in the highway lanes) to connect them to the Meishin Highway (in particular the very complicated design of the Oyamazaki junction), drivers have to reduce their speed.
Another disadvantage is that drivers often encounter congestion as they attempt to merge into the left lane of the Meishin Highway from the Oyamazaki Junction toward Suita or Osaka.
Moreover, many drivers dislike the winding areas and slopes along the Keiji Bypass, so the Keiji Bypass doesn't fully perform its function as a bypass.
Furthermore, it's a bypass of National Highway 1 (a general national highway), which means it isn't a expressway but a motor highway.
When drivers want to get on the Keiji Bypass toward Suita or Osaka from the east side of the Uji-gawa River (near the Ujihigashi Interchange), they must go to the Ujinishi Interchange.
This is because the Ujihigashi Interchange is a half-interchange.
As a result, local roads linking the Ujihigashi and Ujinishi interchanges are commonly congested during the rush hours.
This area is outside the VICS (Vehicle Information and Communication System) link zone, which makes it difficult for drivers to use their congestion-avoidance schemes.

Higashi Hongan-ji temple is a Shin Buddhist temple in Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto.
It is the head temple of the Otani sect, which is part of the Shinshu Kyodan Rengo (Ten Schools of Shin Buddhism), and also joins Nishi Hongan-ji temple (officially Hongan-ji temple, head temple of the Hongan-ji sect of Shin Buddhism), as one of the main temples of Shin Buddhism.
The official name of the temple was "Hongan-ji" until 1987, since which time it has been "Shinshu Honbyo Temple".
To distinguish it from Nishi Hongan-ji temple, also in Shimogyo Ward, it is often called "O-Higashi-san".
(For history before the east-west split, refer to the article on The History of Hongan-ji Temple.)
Kyounyo (Kouju), the 12th master of Hongan-ji Temple, was given a domain for a temple to the east of Hongan-ji by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, and founded Higashi Hongan-ji Temple when Hongan-ji Temple split in 1602.
Located in present day Karasuma Shichijo, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto, it is called Higashi Temple (Eastern) Hongan-ji Temple because it is to the east of Nishi (Western) Hongan-ji Temple, which is located at Horikawa Shichijo.
It was a religious corporation overseen by the Otani sect until 1987, at which time Hongan-ji Temple was legally dissolved and absorbed by the sect.
After that, Higashi Hongan-ji Temple's official name became "Shinshu Honbyo Temple" ("Honbyo" means the original sanctuary where followers hear the teaching of the patriarch Shinran, the resting place of Shinran).
It is also to distinguish it from the breakaway Higashi Hongan-ji sect of Shin Buddhism and emphasize its propriety.
cf O-Higashi Rebellion
Having had 4 fires in the Edo period, so many that it acquired the nickname, "Flaming Hongan-ji Temple", the current buildings, though many burned and were rebuilt in the Meiji period, maintain the style of the time in their construction and the paintings on the walls.
The Goei-do, which houses the statue of Shinran Shonin, is among the largest wooden buildings in the world (currently covered by scaffolding for a major restoration).
The Goei-do Gate is also one of the three famous gates of Kyoto.
Shinran's "Kyogyo Shinsho" (National Treasure) (Bando Edition) is in its possession.
Shosei-en Garden, on the neighboring grounds, is a national scenic area.
The current master of the temple is Choken OTANI (Jonyo).

Under the prewar school educational system, Third High School was one of the high schools that later became a foundation of the present Kyoto University.
The school was commonly called "Sanko."
Hikoichi ORITA was its first president.
1869: Seimi-kyoku was founded in Osaka
The school underwent continuous changes in structure and nomenclature.
1870: Institute of Chemistry (Kagakusho)→Institute of Science (Rigakusho)→Kaiseijo→
1872: Fourth University District No. 1 Junior High School*→
1873: Third University District No. 1 Junior High School→Kaimei Gakko→
1874: Osaka School of Foreign Languages→Osaka English Academy
1879: Osaka Technical College
1880: Osaka Middle School
1885: It was reorganized as a branch school of a university, after which the Third Higher Middle School (Dai San Koto Chugakko) was established in 1886.
1887: Okayama Prefectural Medical School became the Third Higher Middle School Medical Faculty (Sakae-machi, Okayama City).
The main curriculum (university preparatory education) started.
1889: Third Higher Middle School was relocated from Higashi-ku (present-day Chuo-ku), Osaka City to Kamigyo-ku (present-day Sakyo-ku), Kyoto City.
The College of Law was also founded in addition to the already established College of Medicine.

Amaterasu omikami (Tensho daijin) is a humanized Shinto god in Japanese.
In "Engishiki (List of Official Shrines)," "Amaterasu" of Amaterasu Omikami is cited as "Amateru" when worshipped as the god of nature.
Amaterasu Omikami is the god of the sun and one of the Oyagami (parent deities) of the Imperial Family (the Kososhin (imperial ancestor)).
In "Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters)," Amaterasu Omikami is referred to as 天照大御神 whereas in "Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan)" the god is cited as 天照大神.
Another name given to her is Ohirumenomuchi no kami.
In "Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan)," Amaterasu Omikami is referred to under different names, whereas in "Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters)" she is consistently cited as "天照大御神."
Amaterasu Omikami is considered to be female, but some say the god is male.
Because the name of Amaterasu Omikami was used in the political scene as shown in "Kotai jingu gishikisho," Shoei MISHIMA and Tsutomu SAIJO even argue that Takamimusubi was the Kososhin (imperial ancestor);, and that Hirume was deified and became Amaterasu Omikami.
At Ise Jingu Shrine, Amaterasu Omikami is typically referred to as Amaterasu sume Omikami, Sume Omikami or Amaterasimasu Sume Omikami, particularly when the name is uttered before the altar in ceremonies.
In academic documents she is now customarily spelled "アマテラス" in katakana.
Some say that in old days she was cited as 天照太神.
How Amaterasu omikami is described in myths
According to "Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters)," Amaterasu Omikami was born from Izanagi as she rinsed her left eye when safely returning from Yomi (the world after death) where Izanami lived, in order to remove the dirt.
At this time, Tsukuyomi was born from her right eye and Susanoo from her nose, and the three together have come to be called Mihashira no uzuno miko (three noble children).
Izanagi then instructed Amaterasu Omikami to rule Takamanohara.
Because Susanoo—who had been instructed to rule Unabara (the sea)—kept crying, saying he wanted to go to the land of the roots (the land of Izanami), he was finally expelled by Izanagi.
Although Susanao ascended to Takamanohara to meet Amaterasu Omikami, his elder sister, on the way to the land of the roots, Amaterasu Omikami, who assumed her brother was coming to deprive her of Takamanohara, armed herself and waited for him.
After Susanoo made a pledge to prove that he had no such intention, five male gods were born from Amaterasu Omikami's Monozane (the media from which gods are given birth) and three female gods from that of Susanoo, and Susanoo declared victory.
The following are the five gods considered to be born from Amaterasu Omikami's monozane and are therefore her children:
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Ikutsuhikone
Kumanokusubi
Susanoo, swept up by the event, became wild and violent at Takamanohara, causing his sister to hide herself in Ama no iwato (the cave of heaven).
This threw the entire world into darkness, and various problems occurred.
Yao yorozu no kami-like Chichibu no kami (the god of wisdom), Ameno yagokoroomoikane no mikoto and Ameno koyane no mikoto-eventually became successful in getting her out of Ama no iwato, but she drove him out of Takamanohara.
Amaterasu Omikami—who had decided that she would have one of her sons, Amenooshihomimi, descend to Ashihara no nakatsukuni—dispatched Amatsu kami (the god of heaven) there.
By the time Amenooshihomimi was ready to descend to Ashihara no nakatsukuni, where peace and order had been established, Ninigi—the grandchild of Amaterasu Omikami—was born and ordered to go down there by Amaterasu Omikami.
Interpretations
Because some myths say that Amaterasu Omikami sought opinions from her elder Amatsu Kami (the god of heaven) about her specific acts-whether they were good or not-and even followed his instructions, some consider that Amaterasu Omikami was a deified Emperor who ruled the country by conducting religious services.
Others have viewed her as a deified miko (female Shinto attendant).
Her alias name, "Hirume," literally means "the woman of the sun," as a miko, an attendant of the sun god.
According to a theory, a miko who had served the god of the sun came to be regarded as identical to the god himself; this caused the god to be thought of as female, although the god of the sun is typically male.
Other theories consider that Amaterasu Omikami is female because her myth was established during the era of Empress Jito, or because Himiko was her model.
The idea that the god of the sun (Amaterasu Omikami) and the god of the moon (Tsukuyomi) were born from the eyes of Izanagi shows a strong influence of Taoism, whose canons "Reiho gobujo" (completed by the sixth century) and "Goho innenkyo" (written at the beginning of the seventh century) respectively contain descriptions of "turning his eyes into the sun and the moon" and "turning his left eye into the sun and his right eye into the moon."
Some say there is a parallelism between Shinto and Taoism in some of the terms used for Ise Jingu Shrine, which worships Amaterasu Omikami—such as okami (great god), Jingu, itsuki no miya, itsuki no yakata, murasaki no mizo, kiyoginu, mitegura and usukinu—and in the idea behind dividing its shrine into Kotai jingu and Toyouke daijingu.
In comparative mythology, the myth of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami is nearly identical to that of Pangu, as recorded earlier (somewhere during the third or fourth century).
Because the story of turning the eyes into the sun and the moon is a common analogy found across Asia, some consider that the myth was propagated as peoples migrated around the region during prehistory.
Some scholars point out that in "Nihon Shoki" (Chronicles of Japan), the divinity of Amaterasu Omikami, was changed in three stages.
The following describes the historical events and their details that triggered the changes:
645: The Taika era reforms took place.
It was after these reforms that the Imperial Family began to worship Amaterasu Omikami.
Hi no kami (the god of the sun) or the sun itself.
A male god called "Amateru" was widely worshipped.
"Engishiki (List of Official Shrines)" lists the shrines that contained within their names the word "Amateru"—like the Amateru Jinja Shrine of Tsushima, the Iiboniamateru Jinja Shrine of Harima and the Amateru mitama no mikoto Jinja Shrine of Tanba.
In fact, Amateru (as the name of the male god) is the alias name of Amaterasu Omikami's grandson Amenohoakari, who is the first ancestor of the Owari, Tsumori and Kaifu clans.
Additionally, Amenohoakari's younger brother was Ninigi, the great-grandfather of Emperor Jimmu.
672: The Jinsin War broke out.
"Ohirumenomuchi (a woman who worships the god of the sun)" or "Tanabatatsume."
Two interpretations exist: first, to consider that the god worshipped was Ohirumenomuchi (a female god), and secondly, to think that the god honored was Amateru, the male god in the form of a snake.
698: Kodai Jingu was elected.
"Amateras," or the ancestor god of the Imperial Family
A female god.
Using Empress Jito as a model, Amaterasu Omikami was changed from the god of nature into a humanized god.
Since then, the "Amaterasu" portion of Amaterasu Omikami, if not meant to be the Kososhin (the ancestor of the Imperial Family), has been pronounced "Amateru."
For example, in "Sarashina Nikki (Sarashina Diary)," written around 1060, the Amaterasu Omikami was cited as "天照御神" and the portion of "天照" was pronounced "amateru," while in "Sendai kujihongi," "天照孁" is provided with the furigana readings "アマテルヒルメノムチ" ("amateru hirumenomuchi").
From 1880 to 1881, a fierce debate took place over the Shinto doctrine concerning which gods should be enshrined in the temple of Shinto Jimukyoku (office) in Hibiya, Tokyo.
Shito Jimukyoku, which had decided to enshrine in its temple four gods and Zokasanshin (the three gods of creation)-Ameno minakanushi no kami, Takamimusubi no kami and Kamimusubi no kami-and Amaterasu Omikami met with opposition from the Izumo group, which stressed the idea of Yuken ichinyo (the unity of this world and the world after death) and insisted on worshipping five gods, including Okuni nushi no okami, the ruling god of Yukai (the world after death).
However, the Ise group, which had played the central role in Shito Jimukyoku, argued that Amaterasu Omikami was the Great God of Heaven and Earth, which ruled Kenrei (this world and the world after death) and that other gods were simply her subordinates, thus creating a full-scale confrontation between the two.
This confrontation escalated to the point where various rumors circulated that the Izumo group might be trying to settle a deep-seated grudge against the Ise group, which had accumulated since the era of gods, and that Takatomi SENGE, who had been disloyal to the Imperial Family, had to be killed as punishment.
This debate was eventually brought to an end by the decision of Emperor Meiji, resulting in the defeat of the Izumo group, and Amaterasu Omikami was ranked at the highest level of all the gods.
The government is said to have learned from this debate that it was impossible to establish a common Shinto doctrine and to rule the people of the modern state directly through its restoration.
For more information, see "Debate Regarding the Gods to Be Enshrined," by Shinto Jimukyoku, Kokka Shinto (State Shinto).
In depicting Amaterasu Omikami in his novel, Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA used the alias "Ohirumemuchi."
This is because he wanted to depict Amaterasu Omikami as the god of the sun or nature, not the Kososhin (imperial ancestor) associated with the name "Amaterasu Omikami."
In fact, AKUTAGAWA had to make many revisions, additions and deletions to his novels due to the inspection conducted by the army.
Masahiro YASUOKA (1898-1983), the founder of Kinkei Gakuin (1926), said that the Japanese people worshipped Amaterasu Omikami.
Amaterasu omikami represents the ideal of the Japanese spirit to cover the world with the rays of the sun.
The "Izana" of "Izanami" and "Izanagi," which means "to lead," also represents an ideal of the Japanese people who set an example for other peoples in the world as leaders, forerunners and originators.
Shrines that honor Amaterasu omikami
Shrines that worship Amaterasu Omikami are called Shinmei shrines and are scattered across the country, but their chief shrine is the Naiku (inner shrine) of Ise Jingu Shrine.
Kotai jingu is a shrine that houses Yataka no kagami (Mirror of Yataka), one of the Sanshu no jingi (three kinds of treasures), as the object of worship.
Nearly all the shrines in Japan distribute the Shinsatsu (talisman) (Jingu taima (shrine amulet)) of Kotai Jingu Shrine (Tensyo kotai jingu Shrine).
Daimyo is an expression that came from Daimyoshu.
It signifies a person whose name is very famous.
As opposed to a Shomyo.
It originally meant a person who wields influence in a region.
Later, in samurai society, it came to mean a warrior who has a lot of territory or subordinates.
In the Muromachi period the Shugo strengthened their control over their assigned territories and became Shugo Daimyo.
In the Warring States period, Taishin Ryoshu (noble land owners) appeared who established even stronger control over their territories, and were called Daimyobun no Kokujin or Sengoku Daimyo.
In the Edo period the word specified a lord who was granted a territory of 10,000 koku or more from the Edo Shogunate.
Among warriors with less than 10,000 koku, those who belonged to the Shogunate were called Jikisan.
In fact, because the feudal lords that were the Daimyo shared characteristics with Chinese lords (shoko), they were also called Daimyo Shoko.
This section describes the details of the Edo period, recent Daimyo.
For Shugo Daimyo or Sengoku Daimyo, refer to the relevant articles.
Edo Period Daimyo
The rank of Edo period Daimyo was determined by family status, official rank, size of stipend, office, and service.
First, depending on his connection to the Tokugawa Shogun family, related families (Shinpan, Shinpan Daimyo) were classified mainly as Fudai Daimyo (hereditary Daimyo) that were vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara, and Tozama Daimyo (non-hereditary Daimyo) that became vassals around the time of the Battle of Sekigahara.
The first Shogun, Ieyasu, in order to maintain the bloodline in the event that the Shogun household died out, for supervision and control of the Daimyo nationwide, and for support of the Shogunate, established three branch households of the Tokugawa family that were allowed to use the Tokugawa name, and sent the ninth son, Yoshinao TOKUGAWA, to the Owari domain, the 10th son Yorinobu TOKUGAWA to the Kishu domain, and the 11th son Yorifusa TOKUGAWA to the Mito domain.
Beginning with the elder brother of the second Shogun, Hidetada TOKUGAWA, and second son of Ieyasu, Hideyasu YUKI, was sent to the Echizen domain, he placed Tokugawa family members as Daimyo all of the country.
Moreover, over the generations the hereditary vassals that supported the beginning of the Tokugawa Shogun family were placed as Fudai Daimyo, who secured the Shogunate's military power while serving as important officials from the Shogunate's chief minister to members of the council of elders, supported the Shogunate's government.
The Fudai Daimyo had relatively small stipends, and aside from the prominent Fudai Hitto in the Ii clan who received an unusual 350,000 koku in the Hikone domain, the Torii, Sakakibara, Honda and Ogasawara clans received relatively large stipends, but throughout the Edo period only a few Fudai Daimyo maintained more than 100.000 koku, starting with the Sakai, Abe, Hotta, Yanagisawa, and Toda clans.
This was for the separation of influence and military power.
The Tozama Daimyo were the Daimyo that joined after the Battle of Sekigahara, and many had opposed the Tokugawa at Sekigahara.
The Shogunate was very careful about that, actively carried out intelligence gathering activities using spies, and when they feared impropriety or insurrection, did not hesitate to revoke rank.
Representative of the Tozama Daimyo were the Kaga Domain of the Maeda clan, famous for the million koku of Kaga, the Satsuma Domain of the Shimazu clan, a family famous from the Kamakura period, the Sendai Domain of the Date clan, the Fukuoka Domain of the Kuroda clan, the Hiroshima Domain of the Asano clan, the Choshu Domain of the Mori clan, the Yonezawa Domain of the Uesugi clan, the Saga Domain of the Nabeshima clan, the Kumamoto Domain of the Hosokawa clan, the Okayama and Tottori Domains of the Ikeda clan, the Tokushima Domain of the Hachisuka clan, the Tosa Domain of the Tosa Yamauchi clan, and the Akita Domain of the Satake clan.
The status of a Daimyo was defined as Kokushu if their territory was one province or more, or an equivalent number of koku, as Joshu Daimyo (joshu class) if they had a castle, those without a castle were distinguished as Jinya, and the rooms that they occupied at Edo castle during their service there were differentiated based on the Daimyo's status.
Refer to Shikoseki for details.
Aside from Daimyo in charge of provinces, those with 100,000 koku were generally not allowed possession of a whole district, and usually held territory around the castle and in patches.
In extreme cases, rule of a single village was divided between two land holders (aikyu).
Daimyo, as a rule, had 10,000 koku or more, but the Kitsuregawa clan's Kitsuregawa domain was 5,000 koku.
That was because the Kitsuregawa clan were descendants of the Ashikaga clan.
Daimyo were subject to control by the Shogunate through the Laws for the Military Houses and the sankin kotai (alternate attendance) system.
Other than that, there was a system of assignments called otetsudai, and at the end of the Edo period some were ordered to defend the coast, so the Daimyo were always in a difficult position financially.

The Muromachi period dictionary "Setsuyoshu" listed the two pronunciations 'taimei' and 'daimyo,' the former meaning a Shugo (a major feudal lord), and the latter meaning a wealthy person (the wealthy class).
In the Warring States period, the distinction by pronunciation weakened, and it is thought that 'taimei' was common.
The Nippo Jisho (Japanese-Portuguese dictionary) from the beginning of the 17th century also listed the two pronunciations, 'daimyo' and 'taimei,' but there was no clear distinction in meaning, and both were used for major feudal lords.
The pronunciation settled on 'Daimyo' after the beginning of the Edo period, and by the Kansei era they were solely called 'Daimyo.'
